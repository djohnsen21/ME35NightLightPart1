# ME35NightLightPart1
ME 35 - Project 1 Part 1

This is a simple night light that was programmed in micropython and used a Raspberry Pi Pico W with a Cytron daughterboard attachment.

The goals of the project were as follows:

1. Turn the nightlight on and off with MQTT commands
2. Program one of the blue LEDs to continually breathe (get brighter then dimmer then brighter)
3. Sound the buzzer and light the NeoPixel when the button in Pin 20 is pressed
